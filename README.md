# Tamil-Rockers-website
I have created a tamil rockers movie search website using OMDB API  using the React js .where useState is a hook used to manage state in functional components, while useEffect is a hook used to manage side effects (like fetching data, setting up event listeners, or updating the DOM) in functional components.
